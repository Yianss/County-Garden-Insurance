## Getting Started

Welcome to the County Garden Insurance Interface Tool.
To get started, log in with your credentials. You will then be prompted to choose a user. After this you will be shown the possible options for that user.
This program is designed to be as user friendly as possible.

## Customer Interface
The customer interface is used by inputting a customer ID.
The best customer ID's to use are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Customer ID 2 has multiple policies.
Customer ID 2 has an unpaid bill.
Customer ID 1 has multiple insured items.

## Agent Interface
The agent interface is used by inputting an agent ID.
Agent ID's 2 and 3 are the best to test out the program.

## Adjuster Interface
The adjuster interface works similarly to agent interface, requiring an adjuster ID.
All adjuster ID's (1-3) can use the interface.
